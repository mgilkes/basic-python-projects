This is a sample sentence. The word that I was to use is inquire, not enquire. This is a weird sentence.

I believe that by creating a set of basic python projects it will help me to get more accustomed to 
using Python over all the other languages I know. I know several programming languages. I first learned 
QBasic when I was a teenager. My next major language was Java, then C and then C++. After than I learned 
HTML and some CSS. I also learned PHP in the early days when it was PHP4. I taught myself C# when it 
first came out. After that, I basically taught myself Javascript. I don't recall exactly when I first 
learned Javascript though, but I did end up learning more advanced Javascript concepts by myself.

Oh, I also taught myself Objective-C and created an iOS game app called "Match 4 Rainbow" using Cocos2d.
